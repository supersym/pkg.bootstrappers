pkg.bootstrappers
=================

Packages of software application boots-trappers either as regular (POSIX) shell scripts (.sh), MS DOS (.bat), Windows Script Host (.vbs .js .wsf) or more recent PowerShell (.ps1) files to support bootstrapping solutions on any platform. Furthermore, we will support additional libraries, languages, frameworks and applications on desktop, mobile or in the cloud on a more finer-grained level of their package manager if needed such as package.json for Node.js or Bash scripts for Cabal package downloads. Will use curl a lot for HTTP Verbs over the command line.
